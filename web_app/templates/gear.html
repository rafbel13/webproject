<div style="margin-top: 20px;">

<h3>High Altitude Hikes</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Insulated Jacket:</strong> An insulated jacket is a must-have for high altitude hikes, as it provides warmth in cold temperatures. Look for a jacket with high-quality insulation and water-resistant materials.</li>
    <li><strong>Mountaineering Boots:</strong> Mountaineering boots are necessary for high altitude hikes, as they provide support and traction on rough terrain. Look for boots with waterproof materials and durable soles for added stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Backpack:</strong> A backpack is essential for carrying gear and supplies during the hike. Look for a backpack with a comfortable fit and enough capacity to carry all necessary gear.</li>
    <li><strong>Crampons:</strong> Crampons are metal spikes that attach to your boots and provide traction on icy or snowy surfaces. Make sure to choose crampons that fit your boots properly.</li>
    <li><strong>Ice Axe/Piolet:</strong> An ice axe or piolet is a tool used for ice climbing and can also be used for self-arresting in case of a slip or fall on steep terrain. Choose a piolet with a comfortable grip and the right length for your height.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Medium Altitude Hikes</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hiking Shoes:</strong> Hiking shoes provide support and traction on uneven terrain. Look for shoes with a comfortable fit and sturdy soles for added stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Sun protection is important during medium altitude hikes, especially if you'll be hiking in exposed areas. Consider packing a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.</li>
    <li><strong>Water Bottle:</strong> Staying hydrated is essential during hikes, and a reusable water bottle is a great way to ensure you have access to clean water throughout the hike.</li>
    <li><strong>Navigation Tools:</strong> Navigation tools such as a map, compass, or GPS device can help you stay on track during your hike. Make sure you know how to use these tools and bring spare batteries if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>First Aid Kit:</strong> Accidents can happen during hikes, so it's important to bring a basic first aid kit with you. This should include items such as bandages, antiseptic wipes, and pain relievers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that the gear you need may vary depending on the specific hike you plan to do, the season, and the weather conditions. Always check the weather forecast and research the hike before setting out, and don't hesitate to ask local experts for advice on gear and equipment.</p>
